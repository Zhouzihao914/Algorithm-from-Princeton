# Algorithm-from-Princeton
Follow the course Algorithm from Coursera, and record all my private codes here.

I am n master student majored in Electrical Engineering & Automation, I have been trying to apply some machine learning and data mining algorithm to solve my research problem. But, soon, I find that, I need to review the knowledge from data structures so that I can understand and implement these advanced algorithm efficiently. So, I decided to follow the Algorithm course from Princeton. Welcome here!
